Clang 16 does not allow implicit function declarations by default.
When xscreensaver is compiled normally for X11, the function gettimeofday()
is included via the header file X11/Xos.h.
However, if X11 is not used and HAVE_JXYZ is used instead, we end up with a missing
declaration for that function. I think upstream forgot to include the file here, he
has done it for string.h though, which is a similar case.
