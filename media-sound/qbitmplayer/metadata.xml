  <longdescription>
  Media Player written in C++ and Qt.
  Network can optionally be enabled to autodetect other running instances,
  in order to tell that one to show itself instead of opening a new one.
  Although it's called network, <pkg>media-sound/qbitmplayer</pkg> doesn't
  actually do any network related stuff, it just opens a local server for
  subsequent calls to <pkg>media-sound/qbitmplayer</pkg> to connect to it.
  That's the mechanism it uses to detect running instances.
  </longdescription>
  <use>
   <flag name="network">
    Allow a single instance of itself, thus subsequent calls to
    <pkg>media-sound/qbitmplayer</pkg> will just open the already
    opened instance of it.
    </flag>
    <flag name="video">
    Make <pkg>media-sound/qbitmplayer</pkg> not just a Music Player,
    but a Media Player by enabling its ability to play video files as well.
    </flag>
